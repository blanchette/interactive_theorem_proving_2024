/- ## Question 1 (4 points): Logic Puzzles

Consider the following tactical proof: -/

theorem about_Impl :
  ∀a b : Prop, ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  by
    intros a b hor ha
    apply Or.elim hor
    { intro hna
      apply False.elim
      apply hna
      exact ha }
    { intro hb
      exact hb }

/- 1.1 (2 points). Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a proof
term.

Hint: There is an easy way. -/

theorem about_Impl_term :
  ∀a b : Prop, ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  sorry

/- 1.2 (2 points). Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a
structured proof, with `fix`, `assume`, and `show`. -/

theorem about_Impl_struct :
  ∀a b : Prop, ¬ a ∨ b → a → b :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 2 (6 points): Connectives and Quantifiers

2.1 (3 points). Supply a structured proof of the commutativity of `∨` under a
`∀` quantifier, using no other theorems than the introduction and elimination
rules for `∀`, `∨`, and `↔`. -/

theorem Or_comm_under_All {α : Type} (p q : α → Prop) :
  (∀x, p x ∨ q x) ↔ (∀x, q x ∨ p x) :=
  sorry

/- 2.2 (3 points). We have proved or stated three of the six possible
implications between `ExcludedMiddle`, `Peirce`, and `DoubleNegation` in the
exercise of lecture 3. Prove the three missing implications using structured
proofs, exploiting the three theorems we already have. -/
