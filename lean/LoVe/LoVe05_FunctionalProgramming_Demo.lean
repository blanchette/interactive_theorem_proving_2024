/- ## Inductive Types

Recall the definition of type `Nat`: -/

#print Nat

/- Mottos:

* **No junk**: The type contains no values beyond those expressible using the
  constructors.

* **No confusion**: Values built in a different ways are different.

For `Nat`:

* "No junk" means that there are no special values, say, `–1` or `ε`, that
  cannot be expressed using a finite combination of `Nat.zero` and `Nat.succ`.

* "No confusion" is what ensures that `Nat.zero` ≠ `Nat.succ n`.

In addition, inductive types are always finite. `Nat.succ (Nat.succ …)` is not a
value.


## Structural Induction

__Structural induction__ is a generalization of mathematical induction to
inductive types. To prove a property `P[n]` for all natural numbers `n`, it
suffices to prove the base case

    `P[0]`

and the induction step

    `∀k, P[k] → P[k + 1]`

For lists, the base case is

    `P[[]]`

and the induction step is

    `∀y ys, P[ys] → P[y :: ys]`

In general, there is one subgoal per constructor, and induction hypotheses are
available for all constructor arguments of the type we are doing the induction
on. -/

theorem Nat.succ_neq_self (n : ℕ) :
  Nat.succ n ≠ n :=
by
  induction n with
  | zero       => simp
  | succ n' ih => simp [ih]


/- ## Structural Recursion

__Structural recursion__ is a form of recursion that allows us to peel off
one or more constructors from the value on which we recurse. Such functions are
guaranteed to call themselves only finitely many times before the recursion
stops. This is a prerequisite for establishing that the function terminates. -/

def fact : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0     => 1
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) * fact n

def factThreeCases : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0     => 1
  | 1     => 1
  | n + 1 => (n + 1) * factThreeCases n

/- For structurally recursive functions, Lean can automatically prove
termination. For more general recursive schemes, the termination check may fail.
Sometimes it does so for a good reason, as in the following example: -/

/-
-- fails
def illegal : ℕ → ℕ
  | n => illegal n + 1
-/

opaque immoral : ℕ → ℕ

axiom immoral_eq (n : ℕ) :
  immoral n = immoral n + 1

theorem proof_of_False :
  False :=
  have hi : immoral 0 = immoral 0 + 1 :=
    immoral_eq 0
  have him :
    immoral 0 - immoral 0 = immoral 0 + 1 - immoral 0 :=
    by rw [←hi]
  have h0eq1 : 0 = 1 :=
    by simp at him
  show False from
    by simp at h0eq1


/- ## Pattern Matching Expressions

    `match` _term₁_, …, _termM_ `with`
    | _pattern₁₁_, …, _pattern₁M_ => _result₁_
        ⋮
    | _patternN₁_, …, _patternNM_ => _resultN_

`match` allows nonrecursive pattern matching within terms. -/

def bcount {α : Type} (p : α → Bool) : List α → ℕ
  | []      => 0
  | x :: xs =>
    match p x with
    | true  => bcount p xs + 1
    | false => bcount p xs

def min (a b : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  if a ≤ b then a else b


/- ## Structures

Lean provides a convenient syntax for defining records, or structures. These are
essentially nonrecursive, single-constructor inductive types. -/

structure RGB where
  red   : ℕ
  green : ℕ
  blue  : ℕ

#check RGB.mk
#check RGB.red
#check RGB.green
#check RGB.blue

namespace RGB_as_inductive

/- The RGB structure definition is equivalent to the following set of
definitions: -/

inductive RGB : Type where
  | mk : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → RGB

def RGB.red : RGB → ℕ
  | RGB.mk r _ _ => r

def RGB.green : RGB → ℕ
  | RGB.mk _ g _ => g

def RGB.blue : RGB → ℕ
  | RGB.mk _ _ b => b

end RGB_as_inductive

/- A new structure can be created by extending an existing structure: -/

structure RGBA extends RGB where
  alpha : ℕ

/- An `RGBA` is a `RGB` with the extra field `alpha : ℕ`. -/

#print RGBA

def pureRed : RGB :=
  RGB.mk 0xff 0x00 0x00

def pureGreen : RGB :=
  { red   := 0x00
    green := 0xff
    blue  := 0x00 }

def semitransparentGreen : RGBA :=
  { pureGreen with
    alpha := 0x7f }

#print pureRed
#print pureGreen
#print semitransparentGreen

def shuffle (c : RGB) : RGB :=
  { red   := RGB.green c
    green := RGB.blue c
    blue  := RGB.red c }

/- Alternative definition using pattern matching: -/

def shufflePattern : RGB → RGB
  | RGB.mk r g b => RGB.mk g b r

theorem shuffle_shuffle_shuffle (c : RGB) :
  shuffle (shuffle (shuffle c)) = c :=
  by rfl


/- ## Type Classes

A __type class__ is a structure type combining abstract constants and their
properties. A type can be declared an instance of a type class by providing
concrete definitions for the constants and proving that the properties hold.
Based on the type, Lean retrieves the relevant instance. -/

#print Inhabited

instance Nat.Inhabited : Inhabited ℕ :=
  { default := 0 }

instance List.Inhabited {α : Type} : Inhabited (List α) :=
  { default := [] }

#eval (Inhabited.default : ℕ)
#eval (Inhabited.default : List Int)

def head {α : Type} [Inhabited α] : List α → α
  | []     => Inhabited.default
  | x :: _ => x

theorem head_head {α : Type} [Inhabited α] (xs : List α) :
  head [head xs] = head xs :=
  by rfl

#eval head ([] : List ℕ)

#check List.head

instance Fun.Inhabited {α β : Type} [Inhabited β] :
  Inhabited (α → β) :=
  { default := fun a : α ↦ Inhabited.default }

instance Prod.Inhabited {α β : Type}
    [Inhabited α] [Inhabited β] :
  Inhabited (α × β) :=
  { default := (Inhabited.default, Inhabited.default) }

/- We encountered these type classes in lecture 3: -/

#print IsCommutative
#print IsAssociative


/- ## Lists

`List` is an inductive polymorphic type constructed from `List.nil` and
`List.cons`: -/

#print List

/- `cases` performs a case distinction on the specified term. This gives rise
to as many subgoals as there are constructors in the definition of the term's
type. The tactic behaves the same as `induction` except that it does not
produce induction hypotheses. Here is a contrived example: -/

theorem head_head_cases {α : Type} [Inhabited α]
    (xs : List α) :
  head [head xs] = head xs :=
  by
    cases xs with
    | nil        => rfl
    | cons x xs' => rfl

/- `match` is the structured equivalent: -/

theorem head_head_match {α : Type} [Inhabited α]
    (xs : List α) :
  head [head xs] = head xs :=
  match xs with
  | List.nil        => by rfl
  | List.cons x xs' => by rfl

/- `cases` can also be used on a hypothesis of the form `l = r`. It matches `r`
against `l` and replaces all occurrences of the variables occurring in `r` with
the corresponding terms in `l` everywhere in the goal. -/

theorem injection_example {α : Type} (x y : α) (xs ys : List α)
    (h : x :: xs = y :: ys) :
  x = y ∧ xs = ys :=
  by
    cases h
    simp

/- If `r` fails to match `l`, no subgoals emerge; the proof is complete. -/

  false :=

/- `cases` can also be used to perform a case distinction on a proposition, in
conjunction with `Classical.em`. Two cases emerge: one in which the proposition
is true and one in which it is false. -/

#check Classical.em

theorem min_add_add (l m n : ℕ) :
  min (m + l) (n + l) = min m n + l :=

  min (m + l) (n + l) = min m n + l :=
  if h : m ≤ n then
    by simp [min, h]
  else
    by simp [min, h]

  by

/- ## Binary Trees

Inductive types with constructors taking several recursive arguments define
tree-like objects. __Binary trees__ have nodes with at most two children. -/

inductive BinTree (α : Type) : Type where
  | empty : BinTree α
  | node  : α → BinTree α → BinTree α → BinTree α

/- The type `AExp` of arithmetic expressions was also an example of a tree data
structure.

The nodes of a tree, whether inner nodes or leaf nodes, often carry labels or
other annotations.

Inductive trees contain no infinite branches, not even cycles. This is less
expressive than pointer- or reference-based data structures (in imperative
languages) but easier to reason about.

Recursive definitions (and proofs by induction) work roughly as for lists, but
we may need to recurse (or invoke the induction hypothesis) on several child
nodes. -/

  mirror (mirror t) = t :=
