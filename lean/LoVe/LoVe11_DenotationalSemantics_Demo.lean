/- # LoVe Demo 11: Denotational Semantics

We review a third way to specify the semantics of a programming language:
denotational semantics. Denotational semantics attempts to directly specify the
meaning of programs.

If operational semantics is an idealized interpreter and Hoare logic is an
idealized verifier, then denotational semantics is an idealized compiler. -/

/- ## Compositionality

A __denotational semantics__ defines the meaning of each program as a
mathematical object:

    `⟦ ⟧ : syntax → semantics`

A key property of denotational semantics is __compositionality__: The meaning of
a compound statement should be defined in terms of the meaning of its
components. This disqualifies

    `⟦S⟧ = {st | (S, Prod.fst st) ⟹ Prod.snd st}`

(i.e.

    `⟦S⟧ = {(s, t) | (S, s) ⟹ t}`)

because operational semantics is not compositional.

In short, we want

    `⟦S; T⟧               = … ⟦S⟧ … ⟦T⟧ …`
    `⟦if b then S else T⟧ = … ⟦S⟧ … ⟦T⟧ …`
    `⟦while b do S⟧       = … ⟦S⟧ …`

An evaluation function on arithmetic expressions

    `eval : AExp → ((String → ℤ) → ℤ)`

is a denotational semantics. We want the same for imperative programs.


## A Relational Denotational Semantics

We can represent the semantics of an imperative program as a function from
initial state to final state or more generally as a relation between initial
state and final state: `Set (State × State)`.

For `skip`, `:=`, `;`, and `if then else`, the denotational semantics is
easy: -/

namespace SorryDefs

def denote : Stmt → Set (State × State)
  | Stmt.skip             => Id
  | Stmt.assign x a       =>
    {st | Prod.snd st = (Prod.fst st)[x ↦ a (Prod.fst st)]}
  | Stmt.seq S T          => denote S ◯ denote T
  | Stmt.ifThenElse B S T =>
    (denote S ⇃ B) ∪ (denote T ⇃ (fun s ↦ ¬ B s))
  | Stmt.whileDo b S      => sorry

end SorryDefs

/- We write `⟦S⟧` for `denote S`. For `while`, we would like to write

    `((denote S ◯ denote (Stmt.whileDo b S)) ⇃ b)`
    `∪ (Id ⇃ (fun s ↦ ¬ b s))`

but this is ill-founded due to the recursive call on `Stmt.whileDo b S`.

What we are looking for is an `X` such that

    `X = ((denote S ◯ X) ⇃ b) ∪ (Id ⇃ (fun s ↦ ¬ b s))`

In other words, we are looking for a fixpoint.

Most of this lecture is concerned with building a least fixpoint operator
`lfp` that will allow us to define the `while` case as well:

    `lfp (fun X ↦ ((denote S ◯ X) ⇃ b) ∪ (Id ⇃ (fun s ↦ ¬ b s)))`


## Fixpoints

A __fixpoint__ (or fixed point) of `f` is a solution for `X` in the equation

    `X = f X`

In general, fixpoints may not exist at all (e.g., `f := Nat.succ`), or there may
be several fixpoints (e.g., `f := id`). But under some conditions on `f`, a
unique __least fixpoint__ and a unique __greatest fixpoint__ are guaranteed to
exist.

Consider this __fixpoint equation__:

    `X = (fun (P : ℕ → Prop) (n : ℕ) ↦ n = 0 ∨ ∃m : ℕ, n = m + 2 ∧ P m) X`
      `= (fun n : ℕ ↦ n = 0 ∨ ∃m : ℕ, n = m + 2 ∧ X m)`

where `X : ℕ → Prop` and
`f := (fun (P : ℕ → Prop) (n : ℕ) ↦ n = 0 ∨ ∃m : ℕ, n = m + 2 ∧ P m)`.

The above example admits only one fixpoint. The fixpoint equation uniquely
specifies `X` as the set of even numbers.

In general, the least and greatest fixpoint may be different:

    `X = X`

Here, the least fixpoint is `fun _ ↦ False` and the greatest fixpoint is
`fun _ ↦ True`. Conventionally, `False < True`, and thus
`(fun _ ↦ False) < (fun _ ↦ True)`. Similarly, `∅ < @Set.univ ℕ`.

For the semantics of programming languages:

* `X` will have type `Set (State × State)` (which is isomorphic to
  `State → State → Prop`), representing relations between states;

* `f` will correspond to either taking one extra iteration of the loop (if the
  condition `B` is true) or the identity (if `B` is false).

The least fixpoint corresponds to finite executions of a program, which is all
we care about.

**Key observation**:

    Inductive predicates correspond to least fixpoints, but they are built into
    Lean's logic (the calculus of inductive constructions).


## Monotone Functions

Let `α` and `β` be types with partial order `≤`. A function `f : α → β` is
__monotone__ if

    `a₁ ≤ a₂ → f a₁ ≤ f a₂`   for all `a₁`, `a₂`

Many operations on sets (e.g., `∪`), relations (e.g., `◯`), and functions
(e.g., `fun x ↦ x`, `fun _ ↦ k`, `∘`) are monotone or preserve monotonicity.

All monotone functions `f : Set α → Set α` admit least and greatest fixpoints.

**Example of a nonmonotone function**:

    `f A = (if A = ∅ then Set.univ else ∅)`

Assuming `α` is inhabited, we have `∅ ⊆ Set.univ`, but
`f ∅ = Set.univ ⊈ ∅ = f Set.univ`. -/

end SorryTheorems


/- ## Complete Lattices

To define the least fixpoint on sets, we need `⊆` and `⋂`. Complete lattices
capture this concept abstractly. A __complete lattice__ is an ordered type `α`
for which each set of type `Set α` has an infimum.

More precisely, A complete lattice consists of

* a partial order `≤ : α → α → Prop` (i.e., a reflexive, antisymmetric, and
  transitive, and binary predicate);

* an operator `Inf : Set α → α`, called __infimum__.

Moreover, `Inf A` must satisfy these two properties:

* `Inf A` is a lower bound of `A`: `Inf A ≤ b` for all `b ∈ A`;

* `Inf A` is a greatest lower bound: `b ≤ Inf A` for all `b` such that
  `∀a, a ∈ A → b ≤ a`.

**Warning:** `Inf A` is not necessarily an element of `A`.

Examples:

* `Set α` is an instance w.r.t. `⊆` and `⋂` for all `α`;
* `Prop` is an instance w.r.t. `→` and `∀` (`Inf A := ∀a ∈ A, a`);
* `ENat := ℕ ∪ {∞}`;
* `EReal := ℝ ∪ {- ∞, ∞}`;
* `β → α` if `α` is a complete lattice;
* `α × β` if `α`, `β` are complete lattices.

Finite example (with apologies for the ASCII art):

                Z            Inf {}           = ?
              /   \          Inf {Z}          = ?
             A     B         Inf {A, B}       = ?
              \   /          Inf {Z, A}       = ?
                Y            Inf {Z, A, B, Y} = ?

Nonexamples:

* `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℚ`, `ℝ`: no infimum for `∅`, `Inf ℕ`, etc.
* `ERat := ℚ ∪ {- ∞, ∞}`: `Inf {q | 2 < q * q} = sqrt 2` is not in `ERat`. -/

class CompleteLattice (α : Type)
  extends PartialOrder α : Type where
  Inf    : Set α → α
  Inf_le : ∀A b, b ∈ A → Inf A ≤ b
  le_Inf : ∀A b, (∀a, a ∈ A → b ≤ a) → b ≤ Inf A

/- ## Application to Program Equivalence

Based on the denotational semantics, we introduce the notion of program
equivalence: `S₁ ~ S₂`. (Compare with exercise 8.) -/

def DenoteEquiv (S₁ S₂ : Stmt) : Prop :=
  ⟦S₁⟧ = ⟦S₂⟧

infix:50 (priority := high) " ~ " => DenoteEquiv

/- It is obvious from the definition that `~` is an equivalence relation.

Program equivalence can be used to replace subprograms by other subprograms with
the same semantics. This is achieved by the following congruence rules: -/

theorem DenoteEquiv.seq_congr {S₁ S₂ T₁ T₂ : Stmt}
    (hS : S₁ ~ S₂) (hT : T₁ ~ T₂) :
  S₁; T₁ ~ S₂; T₂ :=
