/- ## Question 1: Terms

Complete the following definitions, by replacing the `sorry` markers by terms
of the expected type.

Hint: A procedure for doing so systematically is described in Section 1.4 of
the Hitchhiker's Guide. As explained there, you can use `_` as a placeholder
while constructing a term. By hovering over `_`, you will see the current
logical context. -/

def I : α → α :=
  fun a ↦ a

def K : α → β → α :=
  fun a b ↦ a

def C : (α → β → γ) → β → α → γ :=
  sorry

def projFst : α → α → α :=
  sorry

/- Give a different answer than for `projFst`. -/

def projSnd : α → α → α :=
  sorry

def someNonsense : (α → β → γ) → α → (α → γ) → β → γ :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 2: Typing Derivation

Show the typing derivation for your definition of `C` above, on paper or using
ASCII or Unicode art. You might find the characters `–` (to draw horizontal
bars) and `⊢` useful. -/

-- write your solution in a comment here or on paper
