/- ## Question 1: Type Classes

Recall the inductive type `Tree` we introduced in lecture 5: -/

#check Tree

/- The following function takes two trees and attaches copies of the second
tree to each leaf of the first tree. -/

def Tree.graft {α : Type} : Tree α → Tree α → Tree α
  | Tree.nil,        u => u
  | Tree.node a l r, u =>
    Tree.node a (Tree.graft l u) (Tree.graft r u)

#reduce Tree.graft (Tree.node 1 Tree.nil Tree.nil)
  (Tree.node 2 Tree.nil Tree.nil)

/- 1.1. Prove the following two theorems by structural induction on `t`. -/

theorem Tree.graft_assoc {α : Type} (t u v : Tree α) :
  Tree.graft (Tree.graft t u) v = Tree.graft t (Tree.graft u v) :=
  sorry

theorem Tree.graft_nil {α : Type} (t : Tree α) :
  Tree.graft t Tree.nil = t :=
  sorry

/- 1.2. Declare `Tree` an instance of `AddMonoid` using `graft` as the
addition operator. -/

#print AddMonoid

@[instance] def Tree.AddMonoid {α : Type} : AddMonoid (Tree α) :=
  { add       :=
      sorry
    add_assoc :=
      sorry
    zero      :=
      sorry
    add_zero  :=
      sorry
    zero_add  :=
      sorry
  }

/- 1.3 (**optional**). Explain why `Tree` with `graft` as addition cannot be
declared an instance of `AddGroup`. -/

#print AddGroup

-- enter your explanation here

/- 1.4 (**optional**). Prove the following theorem illustrating why `Tree`
with `graft` as addition does not constitute an `AddGroup`. -/

theorem Tree.add_left_neg_counterexample :
  ∃x : Tree ℕ, ∀y : Tree ℕ, Tree.graft y x ≠ Tree.nil :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 2: Multisets and Finsets

Recall the following definitions from the lecture: -/

#check Finset.elems
#check List.elems

/- 2.1. Prove that the finite set of nodes does not change when mirroring a
tree. -/

theorem Finset.elems_mirror (t : Tree ℕ) :
  Finset.elems (mirror t) = Finset.elems t :=
  sorry

/- 2.2. Show that this does not hold for the list of nodes by providing a
tree `t` for which `List.elems t ≠ List.elems (mirror t)`.

If you define a suitable counterexample, the proof below will succeed. -/

def rottenTree : Tree ℕ :=
  sorry

#eval List.elems rottenTree
#eval List.elems (mirror rottenTree)

theorem List.elems_mirror_counterexample :
  ∃t : Tree ℕ, List.elems t ≠ List.elems (mirror t) :=
  by
    apply Exists.intro rottenTree
    simp [List.elems]
