/- ## Question 1: Vectors as Subtypes

Recall the definition of vectors from the demo: -/

#check Vector

/- The following function adds two lists of integers elementwise. If one
function is longer than the other, the tail of the longer list is ignored. -/

def List.add : List ℤ → List ℤ → List ℤ
  | [],      []      => []
  | x :: xs, y :: ys => (x + y) :: List.add xs ys
  | [],      y :: ys => []
  | x :: xs, []      => []

/- 1.1. Show that if the lists have the same length, the resulting list also
has that length. -/

theorem List.length_add :
  ∀xs ys, List.length xs = List.length ys →
    List.length (List.add xs ys) = List.length xs
  | [], [] =>
    sorry
  | x :: xs, y :: ys =>
    sorry
  | [], y :: ys =>
    sorry
  | x :: xs, [] =>
    sorry

/- 1.2. Define componentwise addition on vectors using `List.add` and
`List.length_add`. -/

def Vector.add {n : ℕ} : Vector ℤ n → Vector ℤ n → Vector ℤ n :=
  sorry

/- 1.3. Show that `List.add` and `Vector.add` are commutative. -/

theorem List.add.comm :
  ∀xs ys, List.add xs ys = List.add ys xs :=
  sorry

theorem Vector.add.comm {n : ℕ} (u v : Vector ℤ n) :
  Vector.add u v = Vector.add v u :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 2: Integers as Quotients

Recall the construction of integers from the lecture, not to be confused with
Lean's predefined type `Int` (= `ℤ`): -/

#check Int.Setoid
#check Int.Setoid_Iff
#check Int

/- 2.1. Define negation on these integers. Observe that if `(p, n)` represents
an integer, then `(n, p)` represents its negation. -/

def Int.neg : Int → Int :=
  sorry

/- 2.2. Prove the following theorems about negation. -/

theorem Int.neg_eq (p n : ℕ) :
  Int.neg ⟦(p, n)⟧ = ⟦(n, p)⟧ :=
  sorry

theorem int.neg_neg (a : Int) :
  Int.neg (Int.neg a) = a :=
  sorry
